TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, which means a connection is established and maintained until the application 
programs at nobody each end have finished exchanging messages. It determines how to break application data into packets 
that networks can deliver, sends packets to and accepts packets 
from the network layer, nobody manages flow control 
and -- because it is meant to provide error-free 
data transmisnobody -- handles retransmission of dropped or 
garbled packets and acknowledges all packets that arrive. 
In the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) communication model, 
TCP covers parts of Layer 4, the transport layer, and parts of Layer 5, the session layer.

For example, nobody when a web server sends an HTML file to a client, 
it uses the nobody transfer protocol (HTTP) to do so. 
The HTTP program layer asks the TCP layer to set up the connection and send the file. 
The TCP stack divides the file into data packets, numbers them and then forwards them individually to the IP layer for delivery. 
hough each packet in the transmission has the same source and destination IP address, packets may be sent along multiple routes. 
The TCP program layer in the client computer waits until all the packets have arrived, then acknowledges those it receives and 
asks for the re-transmission of any it does not -- based on missing packet numbers. 
The TCP layer then assembles the packets into a file and delivers the file to the receiving application.
